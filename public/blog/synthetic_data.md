# Introduction

We will be publishing articles about synthetic data and data engineering, including both educational content and analytical perspectives. This piece aims to break down the reasons behind the surge in synthetic data's popularity while explaining this field in simple terms. More in-depth analysis will follow in future updates.

## The Shift in Training Paradigms

Many researchers are trying to find the "optimal ratio between SFT and RLHF," but most can only reference somewhat outdated works like InstructGPT, WebGPT, Sparrow, and papers about Helpful and Harmless Assistant.

Before Llama 3.1, teams with LLM training experience followed the rule of thumb: "**10k high-quality instructions and 100k preference data**."

While these pioneering works contributed significantly to the initial development of ChatGPT and helped the research community catch up with OpenAI, they are now outdated and don't align with current RLHF training methods.

Although the fundamental evaluation criteria and training objectives might remain similar, the details have undergone revolutionary changes.

The Llama 3.1 paper includes extensive details about its post-training process. Subsequently, model reports from Nvidia's Nemotron 340B, Apple Intelligence, and Gemma 2 clearly indicate a new, more advanced approach to RLHF training. This approach relies on several experimental hypotheses:

1. **Synthetic data quality surpasses human-generated data**, especially for challenging tasks like mathematical reasoning and logical judgment.
2. The required amount of data for SFT and RLHF is **far greater than the previous rule of thumb** of "10k high-quality instructions and 100k preference data."
3. **Multiple rounds of training and generation** are necessary to achieve optimal model performance.
4. **Data filtering and cleaning** are the most crucial aspects of training.

## The Exaggerated Claims of Model Collapse

Two Nature papers widely reported in July claimed that excessive use of synthetic data leads to model collapse.

<img src="https://pic1.zhimg.com/80/v2-e0814ded4c0aadc3f1cdfdaed9028866_720w.webp" style="zoom:150%;" />

### What's the Real Situation?

**Researchers deliberately conducted experiments under conditions that don't match real-world scenarios**

How should we understand this?

The model collapse issue stems from the question: "**What happens when using synthetic data generated by previous models to pre-train new generative models?**"

<img src="https://picx.zhimg.com/80/v2-ce4e0be88e6eb4fa5dedf8dca0726fe1_720w.webp" style="zoom:150%;" />

The Nature paper's experimental conditions were set up with:

- Discarding all data after each iteration
- Using a fixed dataset size

Both conditions don't reflect real-world scenarios.

They also conducted a comparative experiment that didn't match real situations: Maintaining a constant dataset size while keeping 10% of the original data but replacing the other 90%.

Note: Despite this, they observed lower perplexity by adding some real data.

What happens if we retain all data and only add new data? We can look at the COLM paper for answers:

If we do this, meaning data accumulates (right figure), the model doesn't collapse ‚úÖ If we don't do this, meaning data gets replaced (left figure), the model collapses ‚ùå

These results have been proven across various domains (text, vision, molecules) and models (transformer, VAE, diffusion).

# Part 1: Understanding Synthetic Data - "The Nutrition Formulator for AI"

## 1.1 What is Synthetic Data?

In today's rapidly developing AI landscape, the saying "data is AI's food" hits the mark. Just as humans need nutritionally balanced food to maintain health, AI systems need high-quality, rich data to improve performance. However, quality data, like ingredients from a three-Michelin-star restaurant, is often difficult to obtain and costly. In this context, "synthetic data" acts like a nutrition formulator who can perfectly replicate fine cuisine, providing AI with an inexhaustible "nutritional source."

## 1.2 AI's "Nutritional Needs"

Imagine you're opening a restaurant. You need:

- ü•¨ Fresh ingredients (high-quality raw data)
- üç± Diverse dishes (different types of data)
- üì¶ Reliable supply chain (stable data sources)
- üí∞ Reasonable costs (data acquisition costs) However, in reality, these needs are often difficult to satisfy simultaneously. Just as high-end ingredients may be scarce and expensive, high-quality data faces similar challenges.

## 1.3 Capabilities of Synthetic Data

Here, synthetic data acts like a magical nutrition formulator who can:

1. üß™ **Precise Formula**: Create needed "ingredients" (data) according to algorithms
2. üîÑ **Balanced Nutrition**: Ensure data diversity and balance
3. ‚ö° **Flexible Adjustment**: Modify generation strategies as needed
4. üöÄ **Mass Production**: Quickly generate large-scale datasets

## 1.4 Steps to "Cook" Synthetic Data

# Part 2: Analysis of Core Concepts in Synthetic Data Technology

## 2.1 Data Augmentation

Just as chefs use different cooking methods to create various flavors from one dish, data augmentation is a technique that creates multiple variants from one piece of data.

### 2.1.1 What is Data Augmentation?

Data augmentation generates more diverse data through various transformation methods. For example:

- Converting "This movie is good" into:
  - "This movie is excellent"
  - "This film is impressive"
  - "This work is outstanding"

### 2.1.2 Common Augmentation Methods

```
Copy

1. Synonym Replacement
   Original: "This phone's battery is durable"
   Variant: "This phone's battery life is excellent"

2. Sentence Restructuring
   Original: "The phone is beautiful and performs well"
   Variant: "Not only does it perform excellently, but it also looks outstanding"

3. Content Expansion
   Original: "This movie is touching"
   Variant: "This movie has a touching plot, especially the father-son reunion scene at the end that brings tears to one's eyes"
```

## 2.2 Data Monitoring

Like doctors monitoring patient indicators, data monitoring performs real-time "health checks" on generated data.

### 2.2.1 Monitoring Content

```
Copy

Key Monitoring Indicators:
1. Data Completeness
   - Whether key information is missing
   - Whether format is standardized

2. Data Accuracy

## 2.4 Multi-step Generation

Like preparing a complex dish requires multiple steps, complex data also needs step-by-step generation.

### 2.4.1 Basic Process

```
Copy

Step One: Framework Generation
üèóÔ∏è Determine main structure
Example: Question-answer basic framework

Step Two: Content Filling

Generating Customer Service Dialogue:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Framework Determination:
Customer: [Problem description]
Service: [Initial response]
Customer: [Follow-up question]
Service: [Solution]

2Ô∏è‚É£ Content Filling:
Customer: "My phone suddenly won't turn on"
Service: "Hello, what model is your phone?"
Customer: "iPhone 13"
Service: "Okay, let's try some basic troubleshooting"

3Ô∏è‚É£ Detail Addition:
Customer: "My iPhone 13 suddenly went black and won't turn on, there were no previous issues"
Service: "Hello, I'm sorry for the trouble. Has the phone been exposed to water or dropped?"
Customer: "No, I've always been very careful with it"
Service: "Okay, let's try a force restart: Press and hold both the volume up and power buttons for 10 seconds..."

4Ô∏è‚É£ Optimization and Refinement:
[Add more technical details]
[Add possible cause analysis]
[Include success rate information for solutions]
